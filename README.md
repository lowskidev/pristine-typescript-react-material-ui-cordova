# Apache Cordova mobile framework

You will have to have Apache Cordova https://cordova.apache.org installed fully use this repo you can do this by runnning the following command in your terminal `npm install -g cordova` 

This repo comes with a cordova app already bundeled with it, which resides in the `cordovaapp` directory where you will find a file named `config.xml`. Inside that file you can edit your: app name, app description , author information which is recommended since the default is `HelloCordova`

Once you execute `npm run build` it will build your pristine app and copy it over to the `cordovaapp/www/` directory.

Then you can add your mobile app platform by typing: `npm run add-android` for Android and `npm run add-ios` for iOS apps.
this will tell cordova to build your project for the specific platform.

If you already have a platform added in your cordova project and need to updated it, you just need to run `npm run prepare` and it will update the source in your cordova project for all platforms. Or if you want to just updated a specific platform you can also. `npm run prepare-android` for Android or `npm run prepare-ios` for iOS platform.

Your platofrm project folders you can open in either Android Studio or xCode depending. Will be in `cordovaapp/platforms/`

Future updates will include automatic circleCI deployments and support for other platforms as requested.

# Pristine Typescript React Materal UI

An open source repository in its original condition. It leverages Typescript, React, Material UI theming, moment.js and i18next to give a good starting point for new and existing projects.

Pristine Typescript React Material UI is a fork of [Pristine](https://github.com/etclabscore/pristine).

There are a lack of repositories to start from to build community driven, multi-language open source projects. This is a complete starting point, it follows a Documentation Driven Development approach, and can be used as a resource to augment existing documentation.

## Documentation Driven Development

There are many ways to drive open source development. Documenting the problem in the README gives a middle ground between technical and non-technical specifications. This allows organizing solutions to this challenge around community and documentation.

> [...] a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, thereâ€™s something very bad going on.
